# INTERNAL NOTES

Wait, what is this?

This is meant to be a simple starting point for creating Lightning demo projects



# Structure of the project

* doc - documentation resources
  * images - images for documentation
* data - data used in demo
  * queries - queries used in extracting data for demos
  * trees - data trees used for demos
* dx - salesforce dx project
* mdapi - mdapi version of dx project

# How do I use this?

**If using windows: We're in the middle of migrating to a salesforce cli plugin shortly. Please see the How do I use this manual steps below**

**1.** Download the raw shellscript here:
[https://github.com/SalesforceCloudServices/ltng-support-demo-template/blob/createTemplateProject/createTemplateProject.sh](https://github.com/SalesforceCloudServices/ltng-support-demo-template/blob/createTemplateProject/createTemplateProject.sh)

Place it in a folder that you'll want to store your templates. (The template will be cloned and checked out in the same folder)

**2.** Create a github project within the [SalesforceCloudServices Github](https://github.com/SalesforceCloudServices/) <br />
with a name similar to: `ltng-support-NAME_OF_DEMO` <br />
(for example: ltng-support-url-hack)

And copy your new project name.

**(The script will clone the project for you, and populate master for you)**
	
**3.** Run the Shellscript and follow the prompts

	./createTemplateProject.sh
	
	... yadda yadda - remember to make a repo ...
	
	What is the name of the new repository? (ex: ltng-support-url-hack)
	ltng-support-my-project-name
	
	
	The git repository URL is expected to be:
	git@github.com:SalesforceCloudServices/ltng-support-my-project-name.git
	Is this correct? [Y/N]
	y
	
	
	This repository already seems to exist.
	Should we continue? [Y/N]
	y
	
	...
	
	Cloning into 'ltng-support-lds-responsive'...
	
	...
	
	renaming and adding origins
	
	...
	
	pushing project master
	
	...
	
	creating the dx project
	
	...	
	
	-- Your project  has been created
	
	
# How do I use this: Manual Steps

We're in the middle of transitioning from shellscript to a salesforce cli plugin that will accomplish the same as the shellscript.

The manual steps below do the same as the shellscript.

**1.** clone this repository where you will keep your templates:

	git clone git@github.com:SalesforceCloudServices/ltng-support-demo-template.git
	
**2.** import to your demo repo of a similar name: ltng-support-NAME_OF_DEMO

**3.** Create a Salesforce DX project in the 'dx' folder

	//-- newRepositoryName would be the ltng-support-NAME_OF_DEMO
	//-- ex: newRepositoryName="ltng-support-bootstrap"
	sfdx force:project:create --projectname "${newRepositoryName}" -d dx
	
**4.** Rename the org in `config/project-scratch-def.json`
	Change "orgName" value in the JSON to a better name of your scratch org (such as ltng-support-NAME_OF_DEMO)

**5.** Create a scratch org to prepare and store your demo

	// -a [[How you would like to identify the org]]
	// -s [[make the project a default
	// -v [[name of the alias of the lightning support org]]
	// -d [[duration - in days]]
	// -f /path/to/project-scratch-def.json
	
	sfdx force:org:create -d 20 -f config/project-scratch-def.json -s -v [[your hub alias]] -a [[new alias for this scratch org]]
	
	ex:
	
	sfdx force:org:create -d 20 -f config/project-scratch-def.json -v lightningSupport1 -s -a SOME_ALIAS
	
**6.** CLEANUP: Add `**.profiles` within .forceignore, to ensure we do not track profiles (only permission sets)

# Quick Help:

**How do I create a dx project?** <br />
[sfdx force:project:create](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_project.htm#cli_reference_force_project)

**How do I run a script after installation?** <br />
[Create an Apex Class that implements InstallHandler](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/apex_post_install_script_create.htm)

**How do I convert the dx source to metadata api (mdapi folder)?**

	sfdx force:source:convert -r force-app -d ../mdapi

**How do I create a package?**

Be careful, you need to specify the --containeroptions/-o as Unlocked when you create it (and this cannot be changed)

--containeroptions/-o Unlocked  
--name/-n Name of the package  
--description/-d Description of the package  
--targetdevhubusername/-v Alias of the Dev Hub  

	ex:
	sfdx force:package2:create -o Unlocked -n ltng-support-url-hack -d "Demos of how to replace URL Hack Buttons in Lightning" -v lightningSupport1
	
	sfdx force:package:create -e -t Unlocked -r force-app/ -v lightningSupport1 -n ltng-support-schedule-wizard -d "Your Description"
	
[See Here for more](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/modules/unlocked-packages-for-customers/units/build-your-first-unlocked-package)

**Then update the `sfdx-project.json` file**

Add the following to the `packageDirectories` element in that file:

	{
	  "packageDirectories": [ 
	    {
	      "path": "force-app",
	      "default": true,
	      -- add these items below
	      "package": "0Ho_xxx", -- your package2 ID (not subscriber)
	      "versionName": "Version 1.0",
	      "versionNumber": "1.0.0.NEXT"
	      -- add the items above
	    }
	  ],
	  "namespace": "",
	  "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",
	  "sourceApiVersion": "42.0"
	}
	
**THEN you need to create a package version**

sfdx force:package:version:create --path force-app/ --wait 10 --installationkeybypass

**Then** - change the deploy url within the `deploy via url` section down below.

	ex: 
	[https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=YOUR_VERSION_ID](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=YOUR_VERSION_ID)
	
	and
	(or simply navigate to `https://YOUR_SALESFORCE_INSTANCE/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0= YOUR_VERSION_ID ` <br />
	if you are already logged in)
	
	turns into
	
	[https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6A000002sreiQAA](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6A000002sreiQAA)
	
	and
	(or simply navigate to `https://YOUR_SALESFORCE_INSTANCE/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0= 04t6A000002sreiQAA` <br />
	if you are already logged in)
	
**How do I export data to trees?**

Create a text file under /data/queries/API_Name__c.txt, with the query to use when exporting out the data.

(Note the query should not include any fields that are read only - such as System fields, etc, but can include [parent-child queries](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_relationships_query_using.htm).

	SELECT Name,
	  (
	    SELECT LastName
	    FROM Contacts
	  )
	FROM Account

Then export using the following command:

	sfdx force:data:tree:export -q data/queries/exampleQuicklinks.txt -d data/trees/

**How do I get my password again?**

sfdx force:user:display -u USERNAME

**How do I create a scratch org?**

	// -a [[How you would like to identify the org]]
	// -s [[make the project a default
	// -v [[name of the alias of the lightning support org]]
	// -d [[duration - in days]]
	// -f /path/to/project-scratch-def.json
	
	sfdx force:org:create -v lightningSupport1 -d 20 -f config/project-scratch-def.json -s -a SOME_ALIAS

# Install

There are three methods available for you to install this demo, so you can play around with it:

(Please note, all are intended as demonstrations and are not intended for deployment to Production as is)

* [Install via URL](#install-via-url)
* [Install Demo via Salesforce CLI](#install-via-salesforce-cli)
* [Install Demo via Ant/Metadata API](#install-via-metadata-api)

## Install via URL

This works very similar to an App Exchange install.

Please login to an available sandbox and click the link below.

@CHANGE: update the link to the installation id (starts with 04t...)
-- ex: /installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6A000002sreiQAA
-- be sure that there are no spaces (it happens...)

[https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=INSTALL_SF_ID](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0= INSTALL_SF_ID)

(or simply navigate to `https://YOUR_SALESFORCE_INSTANCE/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=INSTALL_SF_ID` <br />
if you are already logged in)

@CHANGE: update image to the install package

![Install for Admins](docs/images/installPackage.png)

It is recommended to install for Admins Only (but all options will work)

##### Run Demo Setup

Next, click on the 'dice' and open the 'URL Hack Demo' app.

@CHANGE: update image to your app in the launcher

![URL Hack Demo App](docs/images/appInLauncher.png)

and run `Setup` from the `Demo Setup` tab.

@CHANGE: update the image to your setup page

![URL Hack Demo Setup](docs/images/demoSetup1.png)

This will then perform any additional setup (such as creating records, etc).

##### Run the Demos

Thats it. See the [How to Use](#how-to-use) section for how to use the app.

@CHANGE: Remove the `Known Issue` section if record types are not needed,
-- otherwise, make the following changes in this section

#### -- Known Issue -- Add the missing permissions on the permission set

If you get an error saying 'This record is not available' (when creating records),
you are likely affectd by a known issue with Unlocked Package deploys.

(This is also mentioned from the Setup page)

We are working with different teams, but it appears as though the installation works correctly from Salesforce CLI, but requires additional steps from the insllation URL.

**We appologize for this inconvenience and are working towards correcting it**

**1.** Navigate to the `Demo Setup` page

@CHANGE: update screenshot to exact image within the Setup
@CHANGE: update the DemoSetup Component to the exact names of the record types needed.
@CHANGE: update to the exact names of the record types to add

![Dependent Picklist Demo page](docs/images/correctPermissionSet.png)

and click on the link **Add the 'Master', 'Type A' and 'Type B' record types to the permission set'**

This will navigate you to the permission set in your org.

**3.** Click edit and enable the record types for that permission set.

@CHANGE: update screenshot to exactly the the RecordTypes needed.

![Add record types to permission set](docs/images/correctPermissionSet2.png)

## Installing via the Salesforce CLI

This assumes you have already installed the [Salesforce CLI]() and [Connected the Salesforce CLI to your org](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_web_flow.htm).

However, the Salesforce CLI can be used with any org and does not require Salesforce DX to be enabled. (Although enabling the DX / Dev Hub would give some great benefits, and would only require care of [certain object permissions: Scratch Org Info, ActiveScratchOrg, NamespaceRegistry](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_add_users.htm) - as they are not available in all orgs)

**1.** Run the following command:

	sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d mdapi -u [[orgAlias]] -w

**2.** Add the permission set to your user

@CHANGE: Always use permission sets
- Set the {PermissionSetApiName} to the API name of your Permission Set.

	sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n {PermissionSetApiName} -u [[orgAlias]]
	
**3.** Upload the data

@CHANGE: If data is needed, update the tree file name, often the name of the SObject

	sfdx force:data:tree:import -f data/tree/{SOBJECT}.json -u [[orgAlias]]
	
...

##### Run the Demos

Thats it. See the [How to Use](#how-to-use) section for how to use the app.

	sfdx force:org:open -u [[orgAlias]]
